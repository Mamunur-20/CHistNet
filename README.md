## Abstract

In this study, we introduce **CHistNet**, a novel deep learning framework that leverages **supervised contrastive learning** alongside **cross-entropy loss** to enhance classification performance on histopathology images. The model is first pretrained using contrastive loss to learn robust image representations, followed by fine-tuning with cross-entropy loss for the classification task. This approach achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple histopathology image datasets.
